# Interpretation of LLMs Hidden States in Question Answering
This repository provides dataset and code for the paper "I’ve got the “Answer”! Interpretation of LLMs Hidden States in Question Answering".  

The dataset is a subset of examples from the Russian-language MuSeRC dataset (Fenogenova et al., 2020) augmented by GPT-4's rewritten answers.  

The dataset contains 152 examples, which correspond to 200 pairs of questions and answer groups. Each question-answer pair has 5 true and 5 false answers.

The source MuSeRC dataset is publicly available (https://russiansuperglue.com/tasks/task_info/MuSeRC) and licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).  
Our use of the MuSeRC dataset is limited by research purposes.
